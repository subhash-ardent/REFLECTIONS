Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

clone create a copy of the repository on the git-hub to one's local machine

forks create a copy of the repository on the git-hub to one's git-hub account on its own servers. (i'll first fork and then clone somebody's repository and work it as my own, no changes can be made to the previous code directly.)

Branches are made to make revolutionry changes to the code which may not work and later add those to main code once if they were succesful.
