What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

One can use the existing folder/file to initialize a repository or could create a folder and initialize repository and add files later.

When we initialize a git-repository, the folder/ file becomes a repository and one can see (master) in the end of the directory where a repository is initialized.

This doesn't mean we can execute git log to see the changes because we never created a commit.

Hence learning how to cmmmit is the next major step..
