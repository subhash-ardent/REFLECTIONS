How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I beleive a project should be updated everytime based on the new requirements.
This is a little bit tedious porcess but this can be much better if we have the access to the earlier versions of the code thereby tracking the changes in the code gives us better idea of what needs to be updated in order to meet the new requirements.
Hence one could update the code as fast as possbile thereby  being more efficient.
